# cosmos

### A programming language to test my knowlegde, it's completly inspired by the fact that one of my friends challenged me to write an interpreted language as well as a compiled language. So i took on the challenge that cosmos is the result of it

The syntax of cosmos is going to be closly like javascript while having the library support of C.
In the near future there will also be a game making framework included with the standard library which will be close in funcionality like [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
